## Section 4: Introduction to Testing with Spring Boot

    - Testing with databases.
    - JPA test API:
            - test splice. 
            - Test transaction.
    - Bootstrap in test.

## Section 5: Hibernate with MySQL

    - Configure Hibernate to talk with MySQL.
    - Hibernate DDL Schema generation tool.
        - Hibernate has the ability to reflect on JPA annotated classes to determine necessary database structure.
        - Hibernate schema generation Tool uses reflection on JPA Entities to deermine database structure.
        - default is camel case to snake case.
            - productioNDescription -> PRODUCT_DESCRIPTION.
        - Datatypes are alse defaulted.
        - DB Schema management:
            - You could do it with tools as flyway or liquidbase.
        - Integration test with MySQL
    - Schema initialization.
